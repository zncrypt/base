     * // ...save $hash in database...

     * @param string $password The password to be hashed.
     * @param int $cost Cost parameter used by the Blowfish hash algorithm.
     * The higher the value of cost,
     * the longer it takes to generate the hash and to verify a password against it. Higher cost
     * therefore slows down a brute-force attack. For best protection against brute-force attacks,
     * set it to the highest value that is tolerable on production servers. The time taken to
     * compute the hash doubles for every increment by one of $cost.
     * @return string The password hash string. When [[passwordHashStrategy]] is set to 'crypt',
     * the output is always 60 ASCII characters, when set to 'password_hash' the output length
     * might increase in future versions of PHP (https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php)
     * @throws Exception on bad password parameter or cost parameter.
     * @see validate()
